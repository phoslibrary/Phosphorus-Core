# Phosphorus (core)
> Developed by Isaac Shea for Mantine by @rtivital

This package represents all core elements in the Phosphorus package. For more specialised elements for both web and app applications, use the respective `@phosphorus-web` and `@phosphorus-app` packages. Both the `web` and `app` packages rely on this one to function.

## What is Phosphorus?
Originally an entirely original design package written by Isaac Shea for his personal projects, Phosphorus has now been transformed such that Mantine is the base, and this package acts as a surround on that module to rebuild or improve elements as needed.
This package is not designed for widespread use and has very minimal documentation, however is designed for a more specialised use than Mantine allows for by itself.
